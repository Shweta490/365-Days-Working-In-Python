# Sorting Algorithms

* Insertion Sort

Following are some of the important characteristics of Insertion Sort:<br/>

    1.It is efficient for smaller data sets, but very inefficient for larger lists.<br/>
    2.Insertion Sort is adaptive, that means it reduces its total number of steps if a partially sorted array is provided as input, making it efficient.<br/>
    3.It is better than Selection Sort and Bubble Sort algorithms.<br/>
    4.Its space complexity is less. Like bubble Sort, insertion sort also requires a single additional memory space.<br/>
    5.It is a stable sorting technique, as it does not change the relative order of elements which are equal.<br/>
