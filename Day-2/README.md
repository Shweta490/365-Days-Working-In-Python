# Sorting Algorithms

**1.Bubble Sort**

Following are the steps involved in bubble sort(for sorting a given array in ascending order):<br/>

    1.Starting with the first element(index = 0), compare the current element with the next element of the array.<br/>
    2.If the current element is greater than the next element of the array, swap them.<br/>
    3.If the current element is less than the next element, move to the next element. Repeat Step 1.<br/>



**2.Selection Sort**

Following are the steps involved in selection sort(for sorting a given array in ascending order):<br/>

    1.Starting from the first element, we search the smallest element in the array, and replace it with the element in the first position.<br/>
    2.We then move on to the second position, and look for smallest element present in the subarray, starting from index 1, till the last index.<br/>
    3.We replace the element at the second position in the original array, or we can say at the first position in the subarray, with the second smallest element.<br/>
    4.This is repeated, until the array is completely sorted.<br/>
